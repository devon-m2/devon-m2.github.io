#### Epidemiology | Biostatistics and Data Analysis | Project Management | Columbia and Johns Hopkins Graduate

I am an epidemiologist interested in applying my knowledge of epidemiological methods, study design, biostatistics and data analysis to the real world evidence/pharmacoepidemiology space. I have substantial experience in epidemiological research (with a focus on cancer epidemiology), data analysis, technical writing, systematic reviews, and project management. I have work experience in a diverse range of settings including a biopharmaceutical company, technical consulting firm, and traditional academic research.

I recently completed a Master of Science (MS) degree in Epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I previously graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Johns Hopkins University with a bachelor's degree in Biology (minor in Psychology).
