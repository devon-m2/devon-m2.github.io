#### Epidemiology | Biostatistics and Data Analysis | Project Management | Columbia and Johns Hopkins Graduate

Welcome! I am an epidemiologist interested in applying my knowledge of epidemiological methods, study design, biostatistics and data analysis to the real world evidence/pharmacoepidemiology space. I have substantial experience in epidemiological research (with a focus on cancer epidemiology), data analysis, technical writing, systematic reviews, and project management.

I recently completed a Master of Science (MS) degree in Epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I previously graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Johns Hopkins University with a bachelor's degree in Biology (minor in Psychology). 

When I am not working, you can find me trying a new recipe, exploring an art museum, running, or diving into my latest hobby - bird watching.
