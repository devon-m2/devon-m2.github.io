Master of Science (MS) in Epidemiology Candidate, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health

# About

I am currently an MS candidate in Epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Johns Hopkins University in 2016 with a BA in Biology (minor in Pyschology). 

Following graduation, I worked for two years as a Health Sciences Analyst at ICF, a technical consulting firm. The Health Sciences Practice (within the Data Science and Survey Research Division) provides epidemiological, toxicological, risk and exposure assessments on hazardous environmental exposures (chemical and microbial), and works to identify and quantify the health effects of these pollutants. Projects support the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), and the American Chemistry Council. During my current pursuit of a graduate degree, I have continued part-time work for ICF.
